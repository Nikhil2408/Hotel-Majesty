# Hotel Majesty
  
A static Hotel website consisting of Home, About and Contact Page. The website consists of the landing page layout, description of the Hotel and feedback from the customers layout and the contact page which users can use to fill in the details. Responsiveness was a biggest challenge for me when making this but it is somewhat responsive.

The approach I followed for this project is to study the concepts from the course but instead of coding along with the instructor, did it myself without seeing tutorials and that was cool for me :raised_hands:
